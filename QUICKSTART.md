TO START:

npm install
testrpc
npm start


It was built off of create-react-app / truffle unbox react, but I ended up adding MobX and used decorators so there were a few modifications.  I rely on testrpc for development, which I noticed has a few quirks but the app works fine as long as you adhere to the existing framework.

The only I issue I ran into was the logging wouldn't always return properly, I'm still trying to get to the source of this problem.

Feel free to reach out with any questions!
